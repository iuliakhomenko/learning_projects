1. Body_Performance_EDA_PCA notebook is an attempt of exploring PCA algorithm on a toy dataset
2. SpaceTitanicCompetition.ipynb notebook was created while perticipating in [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic), the main goal was exploring different classical ML algorithms for a binary classification problem, as well as different type of ensembles 
3. Swahili_Audio_Competition.ipynb notebook was created while participating in [this](https://zindi.africa/competitions/swahili-audio-classification/submissions) competition, the main goal was/is to explore the topic of signal processing as a particular type of sequential data, experiment with different configurations and architectures of DNNs, the modeling part is still in progress.
